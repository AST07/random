### INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANISATION MODE

This can be configured using the “Configure” button on the bottom right corner of the initial screen. The major difference between the two modes is the option of logging in, if you are using it as an individual it is quite obvious that you will not need the option mentioned earlier, but if you are a simple organisation, having a simple hierarchy this feature could be very useful. Both of the modes use separate databases, and hence this can be used for personal purposes even at the workplace. You will find the “organisation” mode exclusive features in an upcoming section.

### ORGANISATION MODE EXCLUSIVE FEATURES

When configured to “organisation” mode, you will be greeted with a login page before you can perform the other actions. The login page has the following options:

- **Login**: If you have already created an account, you may use this to login into your account by entering your registered email ID and the password, we offer 2-factor authentication. After this another window with the following options should appear:

- **Request OTP**: You will need to request an otp to the channel being used and created by the admin. As of now, it is compulsory to pass the OTP verification to continue.

- **Show my channel**: Use this option to launch the website of the channel in the default web browser.

- **Register new channel**: Use this option to register a new channel as provided by the admin, by entering the link in the dialogue box that appears.

- **Create new channel**: To be used only by the admin to create a new OTP channel, the website to create the new channel will open in your default web browser, follow the instructions on the website and after successful creation, you may share the link of the channel with the other users.

- **Sign Up**: Use this to create a new account by filling the sign up form that appears next, all the entry labels have usual meaning, and a single email ID cannot be used by 2 users.

This system may not be perfect, but it serves the basic purpose. The following details will be logged at the given locations:

- **Log data in Database**: A table in the database will contain the user activities log of account creation and deletion, and login. This data can not be seen via our software, you may use a database management tool to view the same.

- **Log data in OTP Channel**: OTP requests and, successful and unsuccessful verification of the users.

An account can be deleted by selecting the “Delete” button at the bottom right corner of the "Teacher" window, you will be prompted before you continue.
